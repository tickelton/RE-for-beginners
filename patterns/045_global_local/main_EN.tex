\mysection{Worth noting: global vs. local variables}

Now that you know that global variables are filling with zeroes by \ac{OS} at start
(\ref{BSSClearedByCStd}, \InSqBrackets{\CNineNineStd 6.7.8p10}),
but local variables are not (\ref{noise_in_stack}).

Sometimes, you have a global variable that you forgot to initialize and your program relies on the fact that it has
zero at start.
Then you edit a program and move the global variable into a function to make it local.
It wouldn't be zeroed at initialization anymore and this can result in nasty bugs.
