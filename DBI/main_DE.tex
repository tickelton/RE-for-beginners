%\section{Why ``instrumentation''?}
%
%Perhaps, this is term of code profiling.
%There are at least two methods:
%1) "sampling": you break into running code as many times as possible (hundreds per second), and see, where it is executed at the moment;
%2) "instrumentation": compiled code is interleaved with other code, which can increment counters, etc.
%
%Perhaps, \ac{DBI} tools inherited the term?
